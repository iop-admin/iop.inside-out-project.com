As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

It is a simple, flexible tool which can be used to display the elements on a single Web page such as images, banners, navigation, graphic elements, and text. It is also an excellent tool for presenting a project to clients.<\/p>\r\n<p>Purpose of a Website Storyboard<br \/>\r\nThe purpose of a website storyboard is threefold.<br \/>\r\n1. It serves as an outline of the design approach.<br \/>\r\n2. It defines the elements that need to go on each page.<br \/>\r\n3. It shows the navigational architecture and information flow to the team and demonstrates how the pages are to work together to provide the user\u2019s interactive experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Types of Storyboards<br \/>\r\nThe storyboard for the site should provide an abstract picture or conceptual design of the Web site, which allows the Web producer and the client to see what the site will contain and how it will be organized. Three types of storyboards are detailed below.<\/p>\r\n<p>Presentation storyboard. Used to demonstrate the visualization of the site and solidify the design model; can be compared to an architectural sketch of a new home. On completion of the presentation storyboard, project management should have a clear conceptual framework from which to begin executing the actual design. Once the initial design is approved, the presentation storyboard can be used to create an execution plan. This is the type of storyboard required for the next assignment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Production storyboard. Used by production teams to present a clear picture of what will be happening throughout the entire site, what each page will look like, and what each team member\/developer will do. This document would be the blueprint and materials list needed for building the house. The production storyboard contains detailed information on graphics, text, video, sound, audience interaction, color, type fonts, type size, etc. This is the blueprint for creating all elements of the Web site, as well as the storage place for page templates, production notes, and an online journal of decisions and deadlines. The production storyboard contains instructions for everything necessary for team members involved in production to do their jobs. Your team should keep a production storyboard up to date as the project continues.<\/p>\r\n<p>Maintenance storyboard. Used by the production team to present a clear picture of what parts of the site will need to be updated or maintained, as well as what parts of the Web site that should be left alone or modified by a professional. This is the plan for site upkeep, such as performing homeowner maintenance. In your final report on this project, you should include some ideas on how the project you have completed should be maintained. If it seems like a good idea, a maintenance storyboard could be part of this final report.<\/p>\r\n<p>What the Storyboard Should Contain<br \/>\r\nTo create effective storyboards, it is not necessary to be a graphic designer. The objective is not to get the design just right. Instead, try to define or identify the elements required for each page. Know how the pages fit into the grander architecture and navigation of the site, not from a technical standpoint, but from a functional, end-user standpoint. The functional specification and the site map should help establish this information. Project directors will more likely be the ones with the best understanding of the project specifications and they should be aware of how all the elements (i.e., content, design, programming, etc.) are progressing and how they will work together to provide the final result. They will also brief the design team on what tasks need to be completed. For these reasons, it is beneficial for the project director to be closely involved with the creation of the storyboards, and ideally working with an information architect and designer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The storyboard for this project must be designed to present to a large group (this class). The class will act as a prospective audience for the project. The storyboard illustration should include:<br \/>\r\n*A flowchart depicting the opening screen and the major sections of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of the text that will be placed on each major page of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of graphic images that belong on each page.<br \/>\r\n*The navigational tools and their location.<br \/>\r\n*The cross-links to all of the information contained on the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*The external links to other Web sites.<br \/>\r\n*The color scheme of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Storyboard Checklist<br \/>\r\nA storyboard can be used to provide the details of an entire Web site by outlining the hierarchy or architecture of a site. Below is a suggested checklist of questions to consider when planning the Website project. This list is to be used as a starting point only when evaluating the components of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Navigation<br \/>\r\n*Does the site design contain numerous links on every page in an effort to keep everything \u201cjust a click away?\u201d Can they be better organized?<br \/>\r\n*Is the navigation weak? Are there a few basic links that then lead to hundreds of wandering links? Do the elements need to be reorganized?<br \/>\r\n*Does the navigation make sense? Will viewers be able to find their way to the information they want if they follow the links provided?<br \/>\r\n*Have links been grouped logically?<br \/>\r\n*Are their gratuitous pages added: links that lead to another page of links?<br \/>\r\n*Is there a way back to the dominant section or home page from the subsections or do viewers have to use the \u201cback\u201d button on their browsers?<\/p>\r\n<p>Site Structure<br \/>\r\n*Given the complexity of the site is it necessary to add a Web site map?<br \/>\r\n*Are other referral elements such as an index needed? Table of contents? Glossary?<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many forms that basically perform the same function? Can they be consolidated?<br \/>\r\n*Is the site balanced or does the site contain just one really good page located in a virtual ghost town?<br \/>\r\nGraphics<br \/>\r\n*Is the site overloaded with graphics? Are they necessary? Are they annoying? Do they go with the content?<br \/>\r\n*Does the site start with a strong graphic presence, only to putter out once further into the site?<br \/>\r\n*Given the number of graphics anticipated per page and per section, are visitors forced to survive the longest downloads on those pages which are utilized most frequently?<br \/>\r\n*Are graphics taking over the page? Does the content get relegated to a tiny visual space?<\/p>\r\n<p>Content<br \/>\r\n* Is the \u201cmeat\u201d of the content hidden too deep into the site to be found?<br \/>\r\n* Is the content being updated most frequently easy to get to?<br \/>\r\n*Are there repeating content elements, such as department Rolodexes that would be better combined into one section.<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many \u201cunder constructions\u201d flags?<br \/>\r\n*Is there too much pointless content, fluff, or dry reading in a more dynamic section? *Is there enough technical information in those areas where it is warranted?<br \/>\r\n*Does the content logically flow within the section? Between sections?<br \/>\r\n*If providing a Web site as a means of answering questions, have questions been answered or are viewers required to email or call for more assistance?<br \/>\r\n*Can the site be created as envisioned or is it too ambitious an undertaking?<\/p>","post_title":"Explore how to storyboard a Web

Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

Repeatedly coming to class late will not be tolerated and may result in a referral to the Division Chair or the Behavioral Intervention Team. Students are expected to notify their instructors by voice-mail or e-mail when they are absent from class.

Each area and level of development or deployment organizations have specific needs and requirements regarding web application security education. A manager needs other information than a security professional or developer. Novices to the profession require other training than people with several years of experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>The OWASP Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>This Education Track provides in a 4 hour session covering what developers should know on web application security. It starts with an explanation of web application security and why it is important. Then the OWASP Top 10 is used to explain the nastiest vulnerabilities and how these can be prevented or re mediated. A secure coding initiative must deal with all stages of a program\u2019s life cycle. Secure web applications are only possible when a secure SDLC is used. The SDLC is explained from the standpoint of people, processes and tools. Particularly for developers good secure development practices are covered in a separate topic. Finally the track finishes with an exhaustive list of web application security resources for web application developers.<\/p>\r\n<h2><span id=\"Track_Audience\" class=\"mw-headline\">Track Audience<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>The track audience is web application developers who are unaware there are security issues with contemporary web applications. No prior knowledge of web application security is assumed nor necessary. This track is independent of the coding language or web frameworks used; like PHP, JSF, Java EE or .NET.<\/p>\r\n<p>We must realize that web application developers are only one link - albeit an important one - of the chain that represents the security of a web application. This track aims to make that link as secure as possible, given the constraint of 4 hours.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another important aspect is that web application security should be tailored to the risk profile of an organization and the specific development environment of that organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security\u00a0<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-03-27 23:12:15","post_date_gmt":"2019-03-28 04:12:15","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"was-100-000-understanding-web-application-security-for-developers-course-module","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-22 13:08:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-22 18:08:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=lp_course&#038;p=38844","menu_order":0,"post_type":"lp_course","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"course_category":[{"term_id":"162","name":"College Course","slug":"college-course","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"162","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"162"},{"term_id":"78","name":"General Focus","slug":"general-focus","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"78","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"   ","parent":"0","count":"4","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"78"},{"term_id":"79","name":"IT &amp; Software","slug":"it-software","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"79","taxonomy":"course_category","description":" ","parent":"78","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"79"},{"term_id":"1838","name":"RACC Series","slug":"racc-series","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1838","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"162","count":"3","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1838"},{"term_id":"88","name":"Technology","slug":"technology","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"88","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"  ","parent":"0","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"88"},{"term_id":"1839","name":"Web Application Security","slug":"web-application-security","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1839","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"1","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1839"}],"course_tag":false,"blooms_cognitive_process":false,"knowledge_focus":[{"term_id":"1994","name":"academic","slug":"academic","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1994","taxonomy":"knowledge_focus","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"40456","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1994"}],"id":38844},"7489":{"course_rational":"","course_resources":[{"ID":"13700","post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-11-04 05:45:28","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-04 10:45:28","post_content":"<p>This video is an excerpt from Zac's course on the WordPress REST API, part of the JavaScript for WordPress Master Course.In this video we look at the important technology HTTP, and everything about it we will need to know for working with the WordPress REST API.We talk specifically about the following:- HTTP Clients and Servers- HTTP Requests and Responses- HTTP Messages- HTTP Requests and Status Lines- HTTP Headers- HTTP Message Body- HTTP Headers- HTTPS- HTTP HistoryLINKS:- HTTP Request Methods - https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Methods- HTTP Status Codes - http:\/\/www.restapitutorial.com\/httpstatuscodes.html<\/p>","post_title":"A Deeper Look at HTTP (for WordPress REST API Users) | www.youtube.com","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-deeper-look-at-http-for-wordpress-rest-api-users","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-25 12:59:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-25 17:59:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=knowledge_resource&#038;p=13700","menu_order":"0","post_type":"knowledge_resource","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","pod_item_id":"13700"}],"syllabuses":[{"ID":"14729","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-04 18:28:06","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-04 23:28:06","post_content":"<p>This course teaches students to use Adobe Dreamweaver CC, the industry standard web design application.

Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \"Grades\" section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per week doing homework in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully.

Each area and level of development or deployment organizations have specific needs and requirements regarding web application security education. A manager needs other information than a security professional or developer. Novices to the profession require other training than people with several years of experience.<\/p>\n<p>The OWASP Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences.<\/p>\n<p>This Education Track provides in a 4 hour session covering what developers should know on web application security. It starts with an explanation of web application security and why it is important. Then the OWASP Top 10 is used to explain the nastiest vulnerabilities and how these can be prevented or re mediated. A secure coding initiative must deal with all stages of a program\u2019s life cycle. Secure web applications are only possible when a secure SDLC is used. The SDLC is explained from the standpoint of people, processes and tools. Particularly for developers good secure development practices are covered in a separate topic. Finally the track finishes with an exhaustive list of web application security resources for web application developers.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Track_Audience\" class=\"mw-headline\">Track Audience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The track audience is web application developers who are unaware there are security issues with contemporary web applications.

This track aims to make that link as secure as possible, given the constraint of 4 hours.<\/p>\n<p>Another important aspect is that web application security should be tailored to the risk profile of an organization and the specific development environment of that organization.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Application security is an essential component of any successful project; this includes web applications, open source PHP applications, web services and proprietary business web sites.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

Repeatedly coming to class late will not be tolerated and may result in a referral to the Division Chair or the Behavioral Intervention Team. Students are expected to notify their instructors by voice-mail or e-mail when they are absent from class.

Each area and level of development or deployment organizations have specific needs and requirements regarding web application security education. A manager needs other information than a security professional or developer. Novices to the profession require other training than people with several years of experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>The OWASP Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>This Education Track provides in a 4 hour session covering what developers should know on web application security. It starts with an explanation of web application security and why it is important. Then the OWASP Top 10 is used to explain the nastiest vulnerabilities and how these can be prevented or re mediated. A secure coding initiative must deal with all stages of a program\u2019s life cycle. Secure web applications are only possible when a secure SDLC is used. The SDLC is explained from the standpoint of people, processes and tools. Particularly for developers good secure development practices are covered in a separate topic. Finally the track finishes with an exhaustive list of web application security resources for web application developers.<\/p>\r\n<h2><span id=\"Track_Audience\" class=\"mw-headline\">Track Audience<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>The track audience is web application developers who are unaware there are security issues with contemporary web applications. No prior knowledge of web application security is assumed nor necessary. This track is independent of the coding language or web frameworks used; like PHP, JSF, Java EE or .NET.<\/p>\r\n<p>We must realize that web application developers are only one link - albeit an important one - of the chain that represents the security of a web application. This track aims to make that link as secure as possible, given the constraint of 4 hours.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another important aspect is that web application security should be tailored to the risk profile of an organization and the specific development environment of that organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security\u00a0<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-03-27 23:12:15","post_date_gmt":"2019-03-28 04:12:15","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"was-100-000-understanding-web-application-security-for-developers-course-module","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-22 13:08:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-22 18:08:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=lp_course&#038;p=38844","menu_order":0,"post_type":"lp_course","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"course_category":[{"term_id":"162","name":"College Course","slug":"college-course","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"162","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"162"},{"term_id":"78","name":"General Focus","slug":"general-focus","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"78","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"   ","parent":"0","count":"4","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"78"},{"term_id":"79","name":"IT &amp; Software","slug":"it-software","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"79","taxonomy":"course_category","description":" ","parent":"78","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"79"},{"term_id":"1838","name":"RACC Series","slug":"racc-series","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1838","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"162","count":"3","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1838"},{"term_id":"88","name":"Technology","slug":"technology","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"88","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"  ","parent":"0","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"88"},{"term_id":"1839","name":"Web Application Security","slug":"web-application-security","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1839","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"1","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1839"}],"course_tag":false,"blooms_cognitive_process":false,"knowledge_focus":[{"term_id":"1994","name":"academic","slug":"academic","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1994","taxonomy":"knowledge_focus","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"40456","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1994"}],"id":38844},"7489":{"course_rational":"","course_resources":[{"ID":"13700","post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-11-04 05:45:28","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-04 10:45:28","post_content":"<p>This video is an excerpt from Zac's course on the WordPress REST API, part of the JavaScript for WordPress Master Course.In this video we look at the important technology HTTP, and everything about it we will need to know for working with the WordPress REST API.We talk specifically about the following:- HTTP Clients and Servers- HTTP Requests and Responses- HTTP Messages- HTTP Requests and Status Lines- HTTP Headers- HTTP Message Body- HTTP Headers- HTTPS- HTTP HistoryLINKS:- HTTP Request Methods - https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Methods- HTTP Status Codes - http:\/\/www.restapitutorial.com\/httpstatuscodes.html<\/p>","post_title":"A Deeper Look at HTTP (for WordPress REST API Users) | www.youtube.com","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-deeper-look-at-http-for-wordpress-rest-api-users","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-25 12:59:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-25 17:59:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=knowledge_resource&#038;p=13700","menu_order":"0","post_type":"knowledge_resource","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","pod_item_id":"13700"}],"syllabuses":[{"ID":"14729","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-04 18:28:06","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-04 23:28:06","post_content":"<p>This course teaches students to use Adobe Dreamweaver CC, the industry standard web design application.

Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \"Grades\" section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per week doing homework in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well.

Each area and level of development or deployment organizations have specific needs and requirements regarding web application security education. A manager needs other information than a security professional or developer. Novices to the profession require other training than people with several years of experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>The OWASP Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>This Education Track provides in a 4 hour session covering what developers should know on web application security. It starts with an explanation of web application security and why it is important. Then the OWASP Top 10 is used to explain the nastiest vulnerabilities and how these can be prevented or re mediated. A secure coding initiative must deal with all stages of a program\u2019s life cycle. Secure web applications are only possible when a secure SDLC is used. The SDLC is explained from the standpoint of people, processes and tools. Particularly for developers good secure development practices are covered in a separate topic. Finally the track finishes with an exhaustive list of web application security resources for web application developers.<\/p>\r\n<h2><span id=\"Track_Audience\" class=\"mw-headline\">Track Audience<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>The track audience is web application developers who are unaware there are security issues with contemporary web applications. No prior knowledge of web application security is assumed nor necessary. This track is independent of the coding language or web frameworks used; like PHP, JSF, Java EE or .NET.<\/p>\r\n<p>We must realize that web application developers are only one link - albeit an important one - of the chain that represents the security of a web application. This track aims to make that link as secure as possible, given the constraint of 4 hours.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another important aspect is that web application security should be tailored to the risk profile of an organization and the specific development environment of that organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security\u00a0<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-03-27 23:12:15","post_date_gmt":"2019-03-28 04:12:15","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"was-100-000-understanding-web-application-security-for-developers-course-module","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-22 13:08:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-22 18:08:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=lp_course&#038;p=38844","menu_order":0,"post_type":"lp_course","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"course_category":[{"term_id":"162","name":"College Course","slug":"college-course","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"162","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"162"},{"term_id":"78","name":"General Focus","slug":"general-focus","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"78","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"   ","parent":"0","count":"4","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"78"},{"term_id":"79","name":"IT &amp; Software","slug":"it-software","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"79","taxonomy":"course_category","description":" ","parent":"78","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"79"},{"term_id":"1838","name":"RACC Series","slug":"racc-series","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1838","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"162","count":"3","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1838"},{"term_id":"88","name":"Technology","slug":"technology","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"88","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"  ","parent":"0","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"88"},{"term_id":"1839","name":"Web Application Security","slug":"web-application-security","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1839","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"1","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1839"}],"course_tag":false,"blooms_cognitive_process":false,"knowledge_focus":[{"term_id":"1994","name":"academic","slug":"academic","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1994","taxonomy":"knowledge_focus","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"40456","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1994"}],"id":38844},"7489":{"course_rational":"","course_resources":[{"ID":"13700","post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-11-04 05:45:28","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-04 10:45:28","post_content":"<p>This video is an excerpt from Zac's course on the WordPress REST API, part of the JavaScript for WordPress Master Course.In this video we look at the important technology HTTP, and everything about it we will need to know for working with the WordPress REST API.We talk specifically about the following:- HTTP Clients and Servers- HTTP Requests and Responses- HTTP Messages- HTTP Requests and Status Lines- HTTP Headers- HTTP Message Body- HTTP Headers- HTTPS- HTTP HistoryLINKS:- HTTP Request Methods - https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Methods- HTTP Status Codes - http:\/\/www.restapitutorial.com\/httpstatuscodes.html<\/p>","post_title":"A Deeper Look at HTTP (for WordPress REST API Users) | www.youtube.com","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-deeper-look-at-http-for-wordpress-rest-api-users","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-25 12:59:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-25 17:59:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=knowledge_resource&#038;p=13700","menu_order":"0","post_type":"knowledge_resource","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","pod_item_id":"13700"}],"syllabuses":[{"ID":"14729","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-04 18:28:06","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-04 23:28:06","post_content":"<p>This course teaches students to use Adobe Dreamweaver CC, the industry standard web design application.

Under \"Modules\" the entire course has been laid out in a proprietary order that will guide you through all the learning objectives. Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \"Grades\" section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per week doing homework in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully. As the Instructor, I will monitor the \"Help Forum\" from time to time, but for this course to scale, it will be important that the participants in the course help each other.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach.

It is a simple, flexible tool which can be used to display the elements on a single Web page such as images, banners, navigation, graphic elements, and text. It is also an excellent tool for presenting a project to clients.<\/p>\r\n<p>Purpose of a Website Storyboard<br \/>\r\nThe purpose of a website storyboard is threefold.<br \/>\r\n1. It serves as an outline of the design approach.<br \/>\r\n2. It defines the elements that need to go on each page.<br \/>\r\n3. It shows the navigational architecture and information flow to the team and demonstrates how the pages are to work together to provide the user\u2019s interactive experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Types of Storyboards<br \/>\r\nThe storyboard for the site should provide an abstract picture or conceptual design of the Web site, which allows the Web producer and the client to see what the site will contain and how it will be organized. Three types of storyboards are detailed below.<\/p>\r\n<p>Presentation storyboard. Used to demonstrate the visualization of the site and solidify the design model; can be compared to an architectural sketch of a new home. On completion of the presentation storyboard, project management should have a clear conceptual framework from which to begin executing the actual design. Once the initial design is approved, the presentation storyboard can be used to create an execution plan. This is the type of storyboard required for the next assignment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Production storyboard. Used by production teams to present a clear picture of what will be happening throughout the entire site, what each page will look like, and what each team member\/developer will do. This document would be the blueprint and materials list needed for building the house. The production storyboard contains detailed information on graphics, text, video, sound, audience interaction, color, type fonts, type size, etc. This is the blueprint for creating all elements of the Web site, as well as the storage place for page templates, production notes, and an online journal of decisions and deadlines. The production storyboard contains instructions for everything necessary for team members involved in production to do their jobs. Your team should keep a production storyboard up to date as the project continues.<\/p>\r\n<p>Maintenance storyboard. Used by the production team to present a clear picture of what parts of the site will need to be updated or maintained, as well as what parts of the Web site that should be left alone or modified by a professional. This is the plan for site upkeep, such as performing homeowner maintenance. In your final report on this project, you should include some ideas on how the project you have completed should be maintained. If it seems like a good idea, a maintenance storyboard could be part of this final report.<\/p>\r\n<p>What the Storyboard Should Contain<br \/>\r\nTo create effective storyboards, it is not necessary to be a graphic designer. The objective is not to get the design just right. Instead, try to define or identify the elements required for each page. Know how the pages fit into the grander architecture and navigation of the site, not from a technical standpoint, but from a functional, end-user standpoint. The functional specification and the site map should help establish this information. Project directors will more likely be the ones with the best understanding of the project specifications and they should be aware of how all the elements (i.e., content, design, programming, etc.) are progressing and how they will work together to provide the final result. They will also brief the design team on what tasks need to be completed. For these reasons, it is beneficial for the project director to be closely involved with the creation of the storyboards, and ideally working with an information architect and designer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The storyboard for this project must be designed to present to a large group (this class). The class will act as a prospective audience for the project. The storyboard illustration should include:<br \/>\r\n*A flowchart depicting the opening screen and the major sections of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of the text that will be placed on each major page of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of graphic images that belong on each page.<br \/>\r\n*The navigational tools and their location.<br \/>\r\n*The cross-links to all of the information contained on the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*The external links to other Web sites.<br \/>\r\n*The color scheme of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Storyboard Checklist<br \/>\r\nA storyboard can be used to provide the details of an entire Web site by outlining the hierarchy or architecture of a site. Below is a suggested checklist of questions to consider when planning the Website project. This list is to be used as a starting point only when evaluating the components of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Navigation<br \/>\r\n*Does the site design contain numerous links on every page in an effort to keep everything \u201cjust a click away?\u201d Can they be better organized?<br \/>\r\n*Is the navigation weak? Are there a few basic links that then lead to hundreds of wandering links? Do the elements need to be reorganized?<br \/>\r\n*Does the navigation make sense? Will viewers be able to find their way to the information they want if they follow the links provided?<br \/>\r\n*Have links been grouped logically?<br \/>\r\n*Are their gratuitous pages added: links that lead to another page of links?<br \/>\r\n*Is there a way back to the dominant section or home page from the subsections or do viewers have to use the \u201cback\u201d button on their browsers?<\/p>\r\n<p>Site Structure<br \/>\r\n*Given the complexity of the site is it necessary to add a Web site map?<br \/>\r\n*Are other referral elements such as an index needed? Table of contents? Glossary?<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many forms that basically perform the same function? Can they be consolidated?<br \/>\r\n*Is the site balanced or does the site contain just one really good page located in a virtual ghost town?<br \/>\r\nGraphics<br \/>\r\n*Is the site overloaded with graphics? Are they necessary? Are they annoying? Do they go with the content?<br \/>\r\n*Does the site start with a strong graphic presence, only to putter out once further into the site?<br \/>\r\n*Given the number of graphics anticipated per page and per section, are visitors forced to survive the longest downloads on those pages which are utilized most frequently?<br \/>\r\n*Are graphics taking over the page? Does the content get relegated to a tiny visual space?<\/p>\r\n<p>Content<br \/>\r\n* Is the \u201cmeat\u201d of the content hidden too deep into the site to be found?<br \/>\r\n* Is the content being updated most frequently easy to get to?<br \/>\r\n*Are there repeating content elements, such as department Rolodexes that would be better combined into one section.<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many \u201cunder constructions\u201d flags?<br \/>\r\n*Is there too much pointless content, fluff, or dry reading in a more dynamic section? *Is there enough technical information in those areas where it is warranted?<br \/>\r\n*Does the content logically flow within the section? Between sections?<br \/>\r\n*If providing a Web site as a means of answering questions, have questions been answered or are viewers required to email or call for more assistance?<br \/>\r\n*Can the site be created as envisioned or is it too ambitious an undertaking?<\/p>","post_title":"Explore how to storyboard a Web

The invention of the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. Today, terms like \u201cbleiner@computer.org\u201d and \u201chttp:\/\/www.acm.org\u201d trip lightly off the tongue of the random person on the street.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history.

One of them is time management. Make sure to allocate enough time to do all the required work and beyond.

The same amount of time should be expected and spend in an online class.<\/p>\r\n<p>Find your own time-schedule and follow it through the semester. For some students working on class activities at midnight will be fine while for others working at noon may be better. The key is to find the time that works best for you and be consistent.<\/p>\r\n<p>An extremely important aspect in an online environment is communication between you and the instructor and your peers. Remember, in an online class you are not alone. You have your classmates and your instructor. So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well. So I may ask you for your phone number in case that I need to call.

One of them is time management. Make sure to allocate enough time to do all the required work and beyond.

The same amount of time should be expected and spend in an online class.<\/p>\r\n<p>Find your own time-schedule and follow it through the semester. For some students working on class activities at midnight will be fine while for others working at noon may be better. The key is to find the time that works best for you and be consistent.<\/p>\r\n<p>An extremely important aspect in an online environment is communication between you and the instructor and your peers. Remember, in an online class you are not alone. You have your classmates and your instructor. So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well. So I may ask you for your phone number in case that I need to call.

We keep things as simple as possible because we truly want \u201cEveryone\u201d to enjoy their learning experience! Under \u201cModules\u201d the entire course has been laid out in a proprietary order that will guide you through all the learning objectives. Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \u201cGrades\u201d section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per a week in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully. As the Instructor, I will monitor the \u201cHelp Forum\u201d from time to time, but for this course to scale, it will be important that the participants in the course help each other.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this. I will be happy to entertain any questions you may have about me, my journey, and why I choose to be here and not there.<\/p>\r\n<p>Academics\/Education<br \/>\r\nAs a result of a difficult childhood I was left with no choice but quit high school in the beginning of twelfth grade to work and maintain my apartment at 4th and Walnut, here in Reading. Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute, and finally I completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC. I later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. Moving forward, I will be working toward completing my Masters at Penn State beginning in the spring of 2017. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while traveling through your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\nI have had an exciting career in which I have been fortunate to work with teams from around the world on websites and applications for organizations such as ebay, Godiva, Sony, Dicks Sporting Goods, Toys-R-Us, Ferrari, and many more. I hope by sharing a little about my journey with you so you, you might understand what I have to offer you as a teacher, but more importantly, you establish a level of confidence in the knowledge that I will share with you about the industry and how you might position yourself to succeed.<\/p>\r\n<p>My journey began as a technical trainer for an organization named Managing Editor Inc (MEI) in Jenkintown Pennsylvania. At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my activities as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me when considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating microsites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of Egavas Design.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egavas Design rapidly grew into an office suite filled with developers, project managers, business analysts, and an amazing creative team building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and our business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, we had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with Stream Companies, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/p>\r\n<p>During my time as Director of Technology at Stream Companies I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time ebay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with ebay began.<\/p>\r\n<p>Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of ebay\u2019s capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integration. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established my name as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at ebay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even ebay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed ebay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to ebay.<\/p>\r\n<p>While completing my second tour at ebay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement ebay\u2019s new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering ebay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the ebay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if ebay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed Spanx, iRobot, and Pepperidge Farm ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/p>\r\n<p>With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/p>\r\n<p>Personal<br \/>\r\nWhen I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/p>\r\n<\/section>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-17 13:45:18","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-17 18:45:18","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"meet-your-instructor-professor-brian-savage","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-01-17 13:47:38","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-17 18:47:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=course_object&#038;p=23249","menu_order":0,"post_type":"course_object","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"id":23249},"26605":{"course_object_focus":"","associated_resource":false,"syllabuses_used_in":[{"ID":"22462","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-17 08:45:08","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-17 13:45:08","post_content":"<p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web design aimed at creating sites that provide an optimal viewing experience across devices ranging from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones.

Under \u201cModules\u201d the entire course has been laid out in a proprietary order that will guide you through all the learning objectives. Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \u201cGrades\u201d section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per week on this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully. As the Instructor, I will monitor the \u201cHelp Forum\u201d from time to time, but for this course to scale, it will be important that the participants in the course help each other.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more. I hope through sharing a little about my journey with you so you, you might understand what I have to offer you as a teacher, but more importantly, you establish a level of confidence in the knowledge that I will share with you about the industry and how you might position yourself to succeed.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">My journey began as a technical trainer for an organization named\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/maned.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzaZIw08L2xpQm5EsAjXdB1WVXxw\">Managing Editor Inc (MEI)<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\"> in Jenkintown Pennsylvania. At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

It is a simple, flexible tool which can be used to display the elements on a single Web page such as images, banners, navigation, graphic elements, and text. It is also an excellent tool for presenting a project to clients.<\/p>\r\n<p>Purpose of a Website Storyboard<br \/>\r\nThe purpose of a website storyboard is threefold.<br \/>\r\n1. It serves as an outline of the design approach.<br \/>\r\n2. It defines the elements that need to go on each page.<br \/>\r\n3. It shows the navigational architecture and information flow to the team and demonstrates how the pages are to work together to provide the user\u2019s interactive experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Types of Storyboards<br \/>\r\nThe storyboard for the site should provide an abstract picture or conceptual design of the Web site, which allows the Web producer and the client to see what the site will contain and how it will be organized. Three types of storyboards are detailed below.<\/p>\r\n<p>Presentation storyboard. Used to demonstrate the visualization of the site and solidify the design model; can be compared to an architectural sketch of a new home. On completion of the presentation storyboard, project management should have a clear conceptual framework from which to begin executing the actual design. Once the initial design is approved, the presentation storyboard can be used to create an execution plan. This is the type of storyboard required for the next assignment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Production storyboard. Used by production teams to present a clear picture of what will be happening throughout the entire site, what each page will look like, and what each team member\/developer will do. This document would be the blueprint and materials list needed for building the house. The production storyboard contains detailed information on graphics, text, video, sound, audience interaction, color, type fonts, type size, etc. This is the blueprint for creating all elements of the Web site, as well as the storage place for page templates, production notes, and an online journal of decisions and deadlines. The production storyboard contains instructions for everything necessary for team members involved in production to do their jobs. Your team should keep a production storyboard up to date as the project continues.<\/p>\r\n<p>Maintenance storyboard. Used by the production team to present a clear picture of what parts of the site will need to be updated or maintained, as well as what parts of the Web site that should be left alone or modified by a professional. This is the plan for site upkeep, such as performing homeowner maintenance. In your final report on this project, you should include some ideas on how the project you have completed should be maintained. If it seems like a good idea, a maintenance storyboard could be part of this final report.<\/p>\r\n<p>What the Storyboard Should Contain<br \/>\r\nTo create effective storyboards, it is not necessary to be a graphic designer. The objective is not to get the design just right. Instead, try to define or identify the elements required for each page. Know how the pages fit into the grander architecture and navigation of the site, not from a technical standpoint, but from a functional, end-user standpoint. The functional specification and the site map should help establish this information. Project directors will more likely be the ones with the best understanding of the project specifications and they should be aware of how all the elements (i.e., content, design, programming, etc.) are progressing and how they will work together to provide the final result. They will also brief the design team on what tasks need to be completed. For these reasons, it is beneficial for the project director to be closely involved with the creation of the storyboards, and ideally working with an information architect and designer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The storyboard for this project must be designed to present to a large group (this class). The class will act as a prospective audience for the project. The storyboard illustration should include:<br \/>\r\n*A flowchart depicting the opening screen and the major sections of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of the text that will be placed on each major page of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of graphic images that belong on each page.<br \/>\r\n*The navigational tools and their location.<br \/>\r\n*The cross-links to all of the information contained on the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*The external links to other Web sites.<br \/>\r\n*The color scheme of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Storyboard Checklist<br \/>\r\nA storyboard can be used to provide the details of an entire Web site by outlining the hierarchy or architecture of a site. Below is a suggested checklist of questions to consider when planning the Website project. This list is to be used as a starting point only when evaluating the components of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Navigation<br \/>\r\n*Does the site design contain numerous links on every page in an effort to keep everything \u201cjust a click away?\u201d Can they be better organized?<br \/>\r\n*Is the navigation weak? Are there a few basic links that then lead to hundreds of wandering links? Do the elements need to be reorganized?<br \/>\r\n*Does the navigation make sense? Will viewers be able to find their way to the information they want if they follow the links provided?<br \/>\r\n*Have links been grouped logically?<br \/>\r\n*Are their gratuitous pages added: links that lead to another page of links?<br \/>\r\n*Is there a way back to the dominant section or home page from the subsections or do viewers have to use the \u201cback\u201d button on their browsers?<\/p>\r\n<p>Site Structure<br \/>\r\n*Given the complexity of the site is it necessary to add a Web site map?<br \/>\r\n*Are other referral elements such as an index needed? Table of contents? Glossary?<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many forms that basically perform the same function? Can they be consolidated?<br \/>\r\n*Is the site balanced or does the site contain just one really good page located in a virtual ghost town?<br \/>\r\nGraphics<br \/>\r\n*Is the site overloaded with graphics? Are they necessary? Are they annoying? Do they go with the content?<br \/>\r\n*Does the site start with a strong graphic presence, only to putter out once further into the site?<br \/>\r\n*Given the number of graphics anticipated per page and per section, are visitors forced to survive the longest downloads on those pages which are utilized most frequently?<br \/>\r\n*Are graphics taking over the page? Does the content get relegated to a tiny visual space?<\/p>\r\n<p>Content<br \/>\r\n* Is the \u201cmeat\u201d of the content hidden too deep into the site to be found?<br \/>\r\n* Is the content being updated most frequently easy to get to?<br \/>\r\n*Are there repeating content elements, such as department Rolodexes that would be better combined into one section.<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many \u201cunder constructions\u201d flags?<br \/>\r\n*Is there too much pointless content, fluff, or dry reading in a more dynamic section? *Is there enough technical information in those areas where it is warranted?<br \/>\r\n*Does the content logically flow within the section? Between sections?<br \/>\r\n*If providing a Web site as a means of answering questions, have questions been answered or are viewers required to email or call for more assistance?<br \/>\r\n*Can the site be created as envisioned or is it too ambitious an undertaking?<\/p>","post_title":"Explore how to storyboard a Web

The invention of the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. Today, terms like \u201cbleiner@computer.org\u201d and \u201chttp:\/\/www.acm.org\u201d trip lightly off the tongue of the random person on the street.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently exists about the Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of material written about the Internet.\u00a0<\/p>","post_title":"Explore the history of the Internet, the Web, and

One of them is time management. Make sure to allocate enough time to do all the required work and beyond. Typical classes may require you to spend four to vie hours in the classroom, however, you are expected to spend an average of eight to twelve hours outside the classroom. The same amount of time should be expected and spend in an online class.<\/p>\r\n<p>Find your own time-schedule and follow it through the semester. For some students working on class activities at midnight will be fine while for others working at noon may be better. The key is to find the time that works best for you and be consistent.<\/p>\r\n<p>An extremely important aspect in an online environment is communication between you and the instructor and your peers. Remember, in an online class you are not alone. You have your classmates and your instructor. So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well. So I may ask you for your phone number in case that I need to call.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

It is a simple, flexible tool which can be used to display the elements on a single Web page such as images, banners, navigation, graphic elements, and text. It is also an excellent tool for presenting a project to clients.<\/p>\r\n<p>Purpose of a Website Storyboard<br \/>\r\nThe purpose of a website storyboard is threefold.<br \/>\r\n1. It serves as an outline of the design approach.<br \/>\r\n2. It defines the elements that need to go on each page.<br \/>\r\n3. It shows the navigational architecture and information flow to the team and demonstrates how the pages are to work together to provide the user\u2019s interactive experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Types of Storyboards<br \/>\r\nThe storyboard for the site should provide an abstract picture or conceptual design of the Web site, which allows the Web producer and the client to see what the site will contain and how it will be organized. Three types of storyboards are detailed below.<\/p>\r\n<p>Presentation storyboard. Used to demonstrate the visualization of the site and solidify the design model; can be compared to an architectural sketch of a new home. On completion of the presentation storyboard, project management should have a clear conceptual framework from which to begin executing the actual design. Once the initial design is approved, the presentation storyboard can be used to create an execution plan. This is the type of storyboard required for the next assignment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Production storyboard. Used by production teams to present a clear picture of what will be happening throughout the entire site, what each page will look like, and what each team member\/developer will do. This document would be the blueprint and materials list needed for building the house. The production storyboard contains detailed information on graphics, text, video, sound, audience interaction, color, type fonts, type size, etc. This is the blueprint for creating all elements of the Web site, as well as the storage place for page templates, production notes, and an online journal of decisions and deadlines. The production storyboard contains instructions for everything necessary for team members involved in production to do their jobs. Your team should keep a production storyboard up to date as the project continues.<\/p>\r\n<p>Maintenance storyboard. Used by the production team to present a clear picture of what parts of the site will need to be updated or maintained, as well as what parts of the Web site that should be left alone or modified by a professional. This is the plan for site upkeep, such as performing homeowner maintenance. In your final report on this project, you should include some ideas on how the project you have completed should be maintained. If it seems like a good idea, a maintenance storyboard could be part of this final report.<\/p>\r\n<p>What the Storyboard Should Contain<br \/>\r\nTo create effective storyboards, it is not necessary to be a graphic designer. The objective is not to get the design just right. Instead, try to define or identify the elements required for each page. Know how the pages fit into the grander architecture and navigation of the site, not from a technical standpoint, but from a functional, end-user standpoint. The functional specification and the site map should help establish this information. Project directors will more likely be the ones with the best understanding of the project specifications and they should be aware of how all the elements (i.e., content, design, programming, etc.) are progressing and how they will work together to provide the final result. They will also brief the design team on what tasks need to be completed. For these reasons, it is beneficial for the project director to be closely involved with the creation of the storyboards, and ideally working with an information architect and designer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The storyboard for this project must be designed to present to a large group (this class). The class will act as a prospective audience for the project. The storyboard illustration should include:<br \/>\r\n*A flowchart depicting the opening screen and the major sections of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of the text that will be placed on each major page of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of graphic images that belong on each page.<br \/>\r\n*The navigational tools and their location.<br \/>\r\n*The cross-links to all of the information contained on the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*The external links to other Web sites.<br \/>\r\n*The color scheme of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Storyboard Checklist<br \/>\r\nA storyboard can be used to provide the details of an entire Web site by outlining the hierarchy or architecture of a site. Below is a suggested checklist of questions to consider when planning the Website project. This list is to be used as a starting point only when evaluating the components of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Navigation<br \/>\r\n*Does the site design contain numerous links on every page in an effort to keep everything \u201cjust a click away?\u201d Can they be better organized?<br \/>\r\n*Is the navigation weak? Are there a few basic links that then lead to hundreds of wandering links? Do the elements need to be reorganized?<br \/>\r\n*Does the navigation make sense? Will viewers be able to find their way to the information they want if they follow the links provided?<br \/>\r\n*Have links been grouped logically?<br \/>\r\n*Are their gratuitous pages added: links that lead to another page of links?<br \/>\r\n*Is there a way back to the dominant section or home page from the subsections or do viewers have to use the \u201cback\u201d button on their browsers?<\/p>\r\n<p>Site Structure<br \/>\r\n*Given the complexity of the site is it necessary to add a Web site map?<br \/>\r\n*Are other referral elements such as an index needed? Table of contents? Glossary?<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many forms that basically perform the same function? Can they be consolidated?<br \/>\r\n*Is the site balanced or does the site contain just one really good page located in a virtual ghost town?<br \/>\r\nGraphics<br \/>\r\n*Is the site overloaded with graphics? Are they necessary? Are they annoying? Do they go with the content?<br \/>\r\n*Does the site start with a strong graphic presence, only to putter out once further into the site?<br \/>\r\n*Given the number of graphics anticipated per page and per section, are visitors forced to survive the longest downloads on those pages which are utilized most frequently?<br \/>\r\n*Are graphics taking over the page? Does the content get relegated to a tiny visual space?<\/p>\r\n<p>Content<br \/>\r\n* Is the \u201cmeat\u201d of the content hidden too deep into the site to be found?<br \/>\r\n* Is the content being updated most frequently easy to get to?<br \/>\r\n*Are there repeating content elements, such as department Rolodexes that would be better combined into one section.<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many \u201cunder constructions\u201d flags?<br \/>\r\n*Is there too much pointless content, fluff, or dry reading in a more dynamic section? *Is there enough technical information in those areas where it is warranted?<br \/>\r\n*Does the content logically flow within the section? Between sections?<br \/>\r\n*If providing a Web site as a means of answering questions, have questions been answered or are viewers required to email or call for more assistance?<br \/>\r\n*Can the site be created as envisioned or is it too ambitious an undertaking?<\/p>","post_title":"Explore how to storyboard a Web

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

It is a simple, flexible tool which can be used to display the elements on a single Web page such as images, banners, navigation, graphic elements, and text. It is also an excellent tool for presenting a project to clients.<\/p>\r\n<p>Purpose of a Website Storyboard<br \/>\r\nThe purpose of a website storyboard is threefold.<br \/>\r\n1. It serves as an outline of the design approach.<br \/>\r\n2. It defines the elements that need to go on each page.<br \/>\r\n3. It shows the navigational architecture and information flow to the team and demonstrates how the pages are to work together to provide the user\u2019s interactive experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Types of Storyboards<br \/>\r\nThe storyboard for the site should provide an abstract picture or conceptual design of the Web site, which allows the Web producer and the client to see what the site will contain and how it will be organized. Three types of storyboards are detailed below.<\/p>\r\n<p>Presentation storyboard. Used to demonstrate the visualization of the site and solidify the design model; can be compared to an architectural sketch of a new home. On completion of the presentation storyboard, project management should have a clear conceptual framework from which to begin executing the actual design. Once the initial design is approved, the presentation storyboard can be used to create an execution plan. This is the type of storyboard required for the next assignment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Production storyboard. Used by production teams to present a clear picture of what will be happening throughout the entire site, what each page will look like, and what each team member\/developer will do. This document would be the blueprint and materials list needed for building the house. The production storyboard contains detailed information on graphics, text, video, sound, audience interaction, color, type fonts, type size, etc. This is the blueprint for creating all elements of the Web site, as well as the storage place for page templates, production notes, and an online journal of decisions and deadlines. The production storyboard contains instructions for everything necessary for team members involved in production to do their jobs. Your team should keep a production storyboard up to date as the project continues.<\/p>\r\n<p>Maintenance storyboard. Used by the production team to present a clear picture of what parts of the site will need to be updated or maintained, as well as what parts of the Web site that should be left alone or modified by a professional. This is the plan for site upkeep, such as performing homeowner maintenance. In your final report on this project, you should include some ideas on how the project you have completed should be maintained. If it seems like a good idea, a maintenance storyboard could be part of this final report.<\/p>\r\n<p>What the Storyboard Should Contain<br \/>\r\nTo create effective storyboards, it is not necessary to be a graphic designer. The objective is not to get the design just right. Instead, try to define or identify the elements required for each page. Know how the pages fit into the grander architecture and navigation of the site, not from a technical standpoint, but from a functional, end-user standpoint. The functional specification and the site map should help establish this information. Project directors will more likely be the ones with the best understanding of the project specifications and they should be aware of how all the elements (i.e., content, design, programming, etc.) are progressing and how they will work together to provide the final result. They will also brief the design team on what tasks need to be completed. For these reasons, it is beneficial for the project director to be closely involved with the creation of the storyboards, and ideally working with an information architect and designer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The storyboard for this project must be designed to present to a large group (this class). The class will act as a prospective audience for the project. The storyboard illustration should include:<br \/>\r\n*A flowchart depicting the opening screen and the major sections of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of the text that will be placed on each major page of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of graphic images that belong on each page.<br \/>\r\n*The navigational tools and their location.<br \/>\r\n*The cross-links to all of the information contained on the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*The external links to other Web sites.<br \/>\r\n*The color scheme of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Storyboard Checklist<br \/>\r\nA storyboard can be used to provide the details of an entire Web site by outlining the hierarchy or architecture of a site. Below is a suggested checklist of questions to consider when planning the Website project. This list is to be used as a starting point only when evaluating the components of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Navigation<br \/>\r\n*Does the site design contain numerous links on every page in an effort to keep everything \u201cjust a click away?\u201d Can they be better organized?<br \/>\r\n*Is the navigation weak? Are there a few basic links that then lead to hundreds of wandering links? Do the elements need to be reorganized?<br \/>\r\n*Does the navigation make sense? Will viewers be able to find their way to the information they want if they follow the links provided?<br \/>\r\n*Have links been grouped logically?<br \/>\r\n*Are their gratuitous pages added: links that lead to another page of links?<br \/>\r\n*Is there a way back to the dominant section or home page from the subsections or do viewers have to use the \u201cback\u201d button on their browsers?<\/p>\r\n<p>Site Structure<br \/>\r\n*Given the complexity of the site is it necessary to add a Web site map?<br \/>\r\n*Are other referral elements such as an index needed? Table of contents? Glossary?<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many forms that basically perform the same function? Can they be consolidated?<br \/>\r\n*Is the site balanced or does the site contain just one really good page located in a virtual ghost town?<br \/>\r\nGraphics<br \/>\r\n*Is the site overloaded with graphics? Are they necessary? Are they annoying? Do they go with the content?<br \/>\r\n*Does the site start with a strong graphic presence, only to putter out once further into the site?<br \/>\r\n*Given the number of graphics anticipated per page and per section, are visitors forced to survive the longest downloads on those pages which are utilized most frequently?<br \/>\r\n*Are graphics taking over the page? Does the content get relegated to a tiny visual space?<\/p>\r\n<p>Content<br \/>\r\n* Is the \u201cmeat\u201d of the content hidden too deep into the site to be found?<br \/>\r\n* Is the content being updated most frequently easy to get to?<br \/>\r\n*Are there repeating content elements, such as department Rolodexes that would be better combined into one section.<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many \u201cunder constructions\u201d flags?<br \/>\r\n*Is there too much pointless content, fluff, or dry reading in a more dynamic section? *Is there enough technical information in those areas where it is warranted?<br \/>\r\n*Does the content logically flow within the section? Between sections?<br \/>\r\n*If providing a Web site as a means of answering questions, have questions been answered or are viewers required to email or call for more assistance?<br \/>\r\n*Can the site be created as envisioned or is it too ambitious an undertaking?<\/p>","post_title":"Explore how to storyboard a Web

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

It is a simple, flexible tool which can be used to display the elements on a single Web page such as images, banners, navigation, graphic elements, and text. It is also an excellent tool for presenting a project to clients.<\/p>\r\n<p>Purpose of a Website Storyboard<br \/>\r\nThe purpose of a website storyboard is threefold.<br \/>\r\n1. It serves as an outline of the design approach.<br \/>\r\n2. It defines the elements that need to go on each page.<br \/>\r\n3. It shows the navigational architecture and information flow to the team and demonstrates how the pages are to work together to provide the user\u2019s interactive experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Types of Storyboards<br \/>\r\nThe storyboard for the site should provide an abstract picture or conceptual design of the Web site, which allows the Web producer and the client to see what the site will contain and how it will be organized. Three types of storyboards are detailed below.<\/p>\r\n<p>Presentation storyboard. Used to demonstrate the visualization of the site and solidify the design model; can be compared to an architectural sketch of a new home. On completion of the presentation storyboard, project management should have a clear conceptual framework from which to begin executing the actual design. Once the initial design is approved, the presentation storyboard can be used to create an execution plan. This is the type of storyboard required for the next assignment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Production storyboard. Used by production teams to present a clear picture of what will be happening throughout the entire site, what each page will look like, and what each team member\/developer will do. This document would be the blueprint and materials list needed for building the house. The production storyboard contains detailed information on graphics, text, video, sound, audience interaction, color, type fonts, type size, etc. This is the blueprint for creating all elements of the Web site, as well as the storage place for page templates, production notes, and an online journal of decisions and deadlines. The production storyboard contains instructions for everything necessary for team members involved in production to do their jobs. Your team should keep a production storyboard up to date as the project continues.<\/p>\r\n<p>Maintenance storyboard. Used by the production team to present a clear picture of what parts of the site will need to be updated or maintained, as well as what parts of the Web site that should be left alone or modified by a professional. This is the plan for site upkeep, such as performing homeowner maintenance. In your final report on this project, you should include some ideas on how the project you have completed should be maintained. If it seems like a good idea, a maintenance storyboard could be part of this final report.<\/p>\r\n<p>What the Storyboard Should Contain<br \/>\r\nTo create effective storyboards, it is not necessary to be a graphic designer. The objective is not to get the design just right. Instead, try to define or identify the elements required for each page. Know how the pages fit into the grander architecture and navigation of the site, not from a technical standpoint, but from a functional, end-user standpoint. The functional specification and the site map should help establish this information. Project directors will more likely be the ones with the best understanding of the project specifications and they should be aware of how all the elements (i.e., content, design, programming, etc.) are progressing and how they will work together to provide the final result. They will also brief the design team on what tasks need to be completed. For these reasons, it is beneficial for the project director to be closely involved with the creation of the storyboards, and ideally working with an information architect and designer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The storyboard for this project must be designed to present to a large group (this class). The class will act as a prospective audience for the project. The storyboard illustration should include:<br \/>\r\n*A flowchart depicting the opening screen and the major sections of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of the text that will be placed on each major page of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of graphic images that belong on each page.<br \/>\r\n*The navigational tools and their location.<br \/>\r\n*The cross-links to all of the information contained on the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*The external links to other Web sites.<br \/>\r\n*The color scheme of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Storyboard Checklist<br \/>\r\nA storyboard can be used to provide the details of an entire Web site by outlining the hierarchy or architecture of a site. Below is a suggested checklist of questions to consider when planning the Website project. This list is to be used as a starting point only when evaluating the components of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Navigation<br \/>\r\n*Does the site design contain numerous links on every page in an effort to keep everything \u201cjust a click away?\u201d Can they be better organized?<br \/>\r\n*Is the navigation weak? Are there a few basic links that then lead to hundreds of wandering links? Do the elements need to be reorganized?<br \/>\r\n*Does the navigation make sense? Will viewers be able to find their way to the information they want if they follow the links provided?<br \/>\r\n*Have links been grouped logically?<br \/>\r\n*Are their gratuitous pages added: links that lead to another page of links?<br \/>\r\n*Is there a way back to the dominant section or home page from the subsections or do viewers have to use the \u201cback\u201d button on their browsers?<\/p>\r\n<p>Site Structure<br \/>\r\n*Given the complexity of the site is it necessary to add a Web site map?<br \/>\r\n*Are other referral elements such as an index needed?

The invention of the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology.

One of them is time management. Make sure to allocate enough time to do all the required work and beyond. Typical classes may require you to spend four to vie hours in the classroom, however, you are expected to spend an average of eight to twelve hours outside the classroom. The same amount of time should be expected and spend in an online class.<\/p>\r\n<p>Find your own time-schedule and follow it through the semester. For some students working on class activities at midnight will be fine while for others working at noon may be better. The key is to find the time that works best for you and be consistent.<\/p>\r\n<p>An extremely important aspect in an online environment is communication between you and the instructor and your peers. Remember, in an online class you are not alone. You have your classmates and your instructor. So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well. So I may ask you for your phone number in case that I need to call. Again, the key is to keep in touch with your instructor and peers.<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-05 11:41:36","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-05 16:41:36","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"online-course-information","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-01-05 11:41:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-05 16:41:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=syllabus_object&#038;p=14760","menu_order":0,"post_type":"syllabus_object","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"id":14760}},"associated_faqs":[],"assignment_and_lecture_schedule":{"40133":{"syllabus_object_focus":"","associated_resource":false,"syllabuses_used_in":false,"ID":40133,"post_title":"Assignment and Lecture Schedule | Brian Savage | 2019","post_content":"<p>The assignment and lecture schedule is available in Canvas under the Home, Modules, and Syllabus links.<\/p>\r\n<p>The lecture schedule is tentative and subject to change.<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-02 04:05:58","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-02 09:05:58","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"assignment-and-lecture-schedule-brian-savage-2019","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-06-02 04:05:58","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-02 09:05:58","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=syllabus_object&#038;p=40133","menu_order":0,"post_type":"syllabus_object","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"id":40133}},"syllabus_objects":[],"course_objects":[],"canvas_sis_id":"76052","courses_used_in":{"14069":{"course_rational":"","course_resources":false,"syllabuses":[{"ID":"40096","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-05-30 14:17:31","post_date_gmt":"2019-05-30 19:17:31","post_content":"<p>This course teaches students how to plan and design a web site using fundamental web design principles.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

Each area and level of development or deployment organizations have specific needs and requirements regarding web application security education. A manager needs other information than a security professional or developer. Novices to the profession require other training than people with several years of experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>The OWASP Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>This Education Track provides in a 4 hour session covering what developers should know on web application security. It starts with an explanation of web application security and why it is important. Then the OWASP Top 10 is used to explain the nastiest vulnerabilities and how these can be prevented or re mediated. A secure coding initiative must deal with all stages of a program\u2019s life cycle. Secure web applications are only possible when a secure SDLC is used. The SDLC is explained from the standpoint of people, processes and tools. Particularly for developers good secure development practices are covered in a separate topic. Finally the track finishes with an exhaustive list of web application security resources for web application developers.<\/p>\r\n<h2><span id=\"Track_Audience\" class=\"mw-headline\">Track Audience<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>The track audience is web application developers who are unaware there are security issues with contemporary web applications. No prior knowledge of web application security is assumed nor necessary. This track is independent of the coding language or web frameworks used; like PHP, JSF, Java EE or .NET.<\/p>\r\n<p>We must realize that web application developers are only one link - albeit an important one - of the chain that represents the security of a web application. This track aims to make that link as secure as possible, given the constraint of 4 hours.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another important aspect is that web application security should be tailored to the risk profile of an organization and the specific development environment of that organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security\u00a0<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-03-27 23:12:15","post_date_gmt":"2019-03-28 04:12:15","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"was-100-000-understanding-web-application-security-for-developers-course-module","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-22 13:08:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-22 18:08:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=lp_course&#038;p=38844","menu_order":0,"post_type":"lp_course","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"course_category":[{"term_id":"162","name":"College Course","slug":"college-course","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"162","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"162"},{"term_id":"78","name":"General Focus","slug":"general-focus","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"78","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"   ","parent":"0","count":"4","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"78"},{"term_id":"79","name":"IT &amp; Software","slug":"it-software","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"79","taxonomy":"course_category","description":" ","parent":"78","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"79"},{"term_id":"1838","name":"RACC Series","slug":"racc-series","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1838","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"162","count":"3","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1838"},{"term_id":"88","name":"Technology","slug":"technology","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"88","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"  ","parent":"0","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"88"},{"term_id":"1839","name":"Web Application Security","slug":"web-application-security","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1839","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"1","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1839"}],"course_tag":false,"blooms_cognitive_process":false,"knowledge_focus":[{"term_id":"1994","name":"academic","slug":"academic","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1994","taxonomy":"knowledge_focus","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"40456","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1994"}],"id":38844},"7489":{"course_rational":"","course_resources":[{"ID":"13700","post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-11-04 05:45:28","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-04 10:45:28","post_content":"<p>This video is an excerpt from Zac's course on the WordPress REST API, part of the JavaScript for WordPress Master Course.In this video we look at the important technology HTTP, and everything about it we will need to know for working with the WordPress REST API.We talk specifically about the following:- HTTP Clients and Servers- HTTP Requests and Responses- HTTP Messages- HTTP Requests and Status Lines- HTTP Headers- HTTP Message Body- HTTP Headers- HTTPS- HTTP HistoryLINKS:- HTTP Request Methods - https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Methods- HTTP Status Codes - http:\/\/www.restapitutorial.com\/httpstatuscodes.html<\/p>","post_title":"A Deeper Look at HTTP (for WordPress REST API Users) | www.youtube.com","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-deeper-look-at-http-for-wordpress-rest-api-users","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-25 12:59:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-25 17:59:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=knowledge_resource&#038;p=13700","menu_order":"0","post_type":"knowledge_resource","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","pod_item_id":"13700"}],"syllabuses":[{"ID":"14729","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-04 18:28:06","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-04 23:28:06","post_content":"<p>This course teaches students to use Adobe Dreamweaver CC, the industry standard web design application.

Under \"Modules\" the entire course has been laid out in a proprietary order that will guide you through all the learning objectives. Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \"Grades\" section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per week doing homework in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

It is a simple, flexible tool which can be used to display the elements on a single Web page such as images, banners, navigation, graphic elements, and text. It is also an excellent tool for presenting a project to clients.<\/p>\r\n<p>Purpose of a Website Storyboard<br \/>\r\nThe purpose of a website storyboard is threefold.<br \/>\r\n1. It serves as an outline of the design approach.<br \/>\r\n2. It defines the elements that need to go on each page.<br \/>\r\n3. It shows the navigational architecture and information flow to the team and demonstrates how the pages are to work together to provide the user\u2019s interactive experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Types of Storyboards<br \/>\r\nThe storyboard for the site should provide an abstract picture or conceptual design of the Web site, which allows the Web producer and the client to see what the site will contain and how it will be organized. Three types of storyboards are detailed below.<\/p>\r\n<p>Presentation storyboard. Used to demonstrate the visualization of the site and solidify the design model; can be compared to an architectural sketch of a new home. On completion of the presentation storyboard, project management should have a clear conceptual framework from which to begin executing the actual design. Once the initial design is approved, the presentation storyboard can be used to create an execution plan. This is the type of storyboard required for the next assignment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Production storyboard. Used by production teams to present a clear picture of what will be happening throughout the entire site, what each page will look like, and what each team member\/developer will do. This document would be the blueprint and materials list needed for building the house. The production storyboard contains detailed information on graphics, text, video, sound, audience interaction, color, type fonts, type size, etc. This is the blueprint for creating all elements of the Web site, as well as the storage place for page templates, production notes, and an online journal of decisions and deadlines. The production storyboard contains instructions for everything necessary for team members involved in production to do their jobs. Your team should keep a production storyboard up to date as the project continues.<\/p>\r\n<p>Maintenance storyboard. Used by the production team to present a clear picture of what parts of the site will need to be updated or maintained, as well as what parts of the Web site that should be left alone or modified by a professional. This is the plan for site upkeep, such as performing homeowner maintenance. In your final report on this project, you should include some ideas on how the project you have completed should be maintained. If it seems like a good idea, a maintenance storyboard could be part of this final report.<\/p>\r\n<p>What the Storyboard Should Contain<br \/>\r\nTo create effective storyboards, it is not necessary to be a graphic designer. The objective is not to get the design just right. Instead, try to define or identify the elements required for each page. Know how the pages fit into the grander architecture and navigation of the site, not from a technical standpoint, but from a functional, end-user standpoint. The functional specification and the site map should help establish this information. Project directors will more likely be the ones with the best understanding of the project specifications and they should be aware of how all the elements (i.e., content, design, programming, etc.) are progressing and how they will work together to provide the final result. They will also brief the design team on what tasks need to be completed. For these reasons, it is beneficial for the project director to be closely involved with the creation of the storyboards, and ideally working with an information architect and designer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The storyboard for this project must be designed to present to a large group (this class). The class will act as a prospective audience for the project. The storyboard illustration should include:<br \/>\r\n*A flowchart depicting the opening screen and the major sections of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of the text that will be placed on each major page of the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*A description of graphic images that belong on each page.<br \/>\r\n*The navigational tools and their location.<br \/>\r\n*The cross-links to all of the information contained on the Web site.<br \/>\r\n*The external links to other Web sites.<br \/>\r\n*The color scheme of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Storyboard Checklist<br \/>\r\nA storyboard can be used to provide the details of an entire Web site by outlining the hierarchy or architecture of a site. Below is a suggested checklist of questions to consider when planning the Website project. This list is to be used as a starting point only when evaluating the components of the Web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Navigation<br \/>\r\n*Does the site design contain numerous links on every page in an effort to keep everything \u201cjust a click away?\u201d Can they be better organized?<br \/>\r\n*Is the navigation weak? Are there a few basic links that then lead to hundreds of wandering links? Do the elements need to be reorganized?<br \/>\r\n*Does the navigation make sense? Will viewers be able to find their way to the information they want if they follow the links provided?<br \/>\r\n*Have links been grouped logically?<br \/>\r\n*Are their gratuitous pages added: links that lead to another page of links?<br \/>\r\n*Is there a way back to the dominant section or home page from the subsections or do viewers have to use the \u201cback\u201d button on their browsers?<\/p>\r\n<p>Site Structure<br \/>\r\n*Given the complexity of the site is it necessary to add a Web site map?<br \/>\r\n*Are other referral elements such as an index needed? Table of contents? Glossary?<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many forms that basically perform the same function? Can they be consolidated?<br \/>\r\n*Is the site balanced or does the site contain just one really good page located in a virtual ghost town?<br \/>\r\nGraphics<br \/>\r\n*Is the site overloaded with graphics? Are they necessary? Are they annoying? Do they go with the content?<br \/>\r\n*Does the site start with a strong graphic presence, only to putter out once further into the site?<br \/>\r\n*Given the number of graphics anticipated per page and per section, are visitors forced to survive the longest downloads on those pages which are utilized most frequently?<br \/>\r\n*Are graphics taking over the page? Does the content get relegated to a tiny visual space?<\/p>\r\n<p>Content<br \/>\r\n* Is the \u201cmeat\u201d of the content hidden too deep into the site to be found?<br \/>\r\n* Is the content being updated most frequently easy to get to?<br \/>\r\n*Are there repeating content elements, such as department Rolodexes that would be better combined into one section.<br \/>\r\n*Are there too many \u201cunder constructions\u201d flags?<br \/>\r\n*Is there too much pointless content, fluff, or dry reading in a more dynamic section? *Is there enough technical information in those areas where it is warranted?<br \/>\r\n*Does the content logically flow within the section? Between sections?<br \/>\r\n*If providing a Web site as a means of answering questions, have questions been answered or are viewers required to email or call for more assistance?<br \/>\r\n*Can the site be created as envisioned or is it too ambitious an undertaking?<\/p>","post_title":"Explore how to storyboard a Web

The invention of the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. Today, terms like \u201cbleiner@computer.org\u201d and \u201chttp:\/\/www.acm.org\u201d trip lightly off the tongue of the random person on the street.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently exists about the Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of material written about the Internet.\u00a0<\/p>","post_title":"Explore the history of the Internet, the Web, and

One of them is time management. Make sure to allocate enough time to do all the required work and beyond. Typical classes may require you to spend four to vie hours in the classroom, however, you are expected to spend an average of eight to twelve hours outside the classroom. The same amount of time should be expected and spend in an online class.<\/p>\r\n<p>Find your own time-schedule and follow it through the semester. For some students working on class activities at midnight will be fine while for others working at noon may be better. The key is to find the time that works best for you and be consistent.<\/p>\r\n<p>An extremely important aspect in an online environment is communication between you and the instructor and your peers. Remember, in an online class you are not alone. You have your classmates and your instructor.

One of them is time management. Make sure to allocate enough time to do all the required work and beyond.

The same amount of time should be expected and spend in an online class.<\/p>\r\n<p>Find your own time-schedule and follow it through the semester. For some students working on class activities at midnight will be fine while for others working at noon may be better. The key is to find the time that works best for you and be consistent.<\/p>\r\n<p>An extremely important aspect in an online environment is communication between you and the instructor and your peers. Remember, in an online class you are not alone. You have your classmates and your instructor. So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well.

Repeatedly coming to class late will not be tolerated and may result in a referral to the Division Chair or the Behavioral Intervention Team. Students are expected to notify their instructors by voice-mail or e-mail when they are absent from class.

Under \u201cModules\u201d the entire course has been laid out in a proprietary order that will guide you through all the learning objectives. Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \u201cGrades\u201d section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per a week in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this. I will be happy to entertain any questions you may have about me, my journey, and why I choose to be here and not there.<\/p>\r\n<p>Academics\/Education<br \/>\r\nAs a result of a difficult childhood I was left with no choice but quit high school in the beginning of twelfth grade to work and maintain my apartment at 4th and Walnut, here in Reading. Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute, and finally I completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC. I later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. Moving forward, I will be working toward completing my Masters at Penn State beginning in the spring of 2017. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while traveling through your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\nI have had an exciting career in which I have been fortunate to work with teams from around the world on websites and applications for organizations such as ebay, Godiva, Sony, Dicks Sporting Goods, Toys-R-Us, Ferrari, and many more. I hope by sharing a little about my journey with you so you, you might understand what I have to offer you as a teacher, but more importantly, you establish a level of confidence in the knowledge that I will share with you about the industry and how you might position yourself to succeed.<\/p>\r\n<p>My journey began as a technical trainer for an organization named Managing Editor Inc (MEI) in Jenkintown Pennsylvania. At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my activities as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me when considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating microsites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of Egavas Design.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egavas Design rapidly grew into an office suite filled with developers, project managers, business analysts, and an amazing creative team building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and our business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, we had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with Stream Companies, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/p>\r\n<p>During my time as Director of Technology at Stream Companies I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time ebay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with ebay began.<\/p>\r\n<p>Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of ebay\u2019s capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integration. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established my name as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at ebay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even ebay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed ebay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to ebay.<\/p>\r\n<p>While completing my second tour at ebay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement ebay\u2019s new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering ebay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the ebay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if ebay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed Spanx, iRobot, and Pepperidge Farm ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/p>\r\n<p>With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/p>\r\n<p>Personal<br \/>\r\nWhen I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world.

The same amount of time should be expected and spend in an online class.<\/p>\r\n<p>Find your own time-schedule and follow it through the semester.

Remember, in an online class you are not alone. You have your classmates and your instructor. So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well.

These modules can be combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>This Education Track provides in a 4 hour session covering what developers should know on web application security. It starts with an explanation of web application security and why it is important. Then the OWASP Top 10 is used to explain the nastiest vulnerabilities and how these can be prevented or re mediated. A secure coding initiative must deal with all stages of a program\u2019s life cycle. Secure web applications are only possible when a secure SDLC is used. The SDLC is explained from the standpoint of people, processes and tools. Particularly for developers good secure development practices are covered in a separate topic. Finally the track finishes with an exhaustive list of web application security resources for web application developers.<\/p>\r\n<h2><span id=\"Track_Audience\" class=\"mw-headline\">Track Audience<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>The track audience is web application developers who are unaware there are security issues with contemporary web applications. No prior knowledge of web application security is assumed nor necessary. This track is independent of the coding language or web frameworks used; like PHP, JSF, Java EE or .NET.<\/p>\r\n<p>We must realize that web application developers are only one link - albeit an important one - of the chain that represents the security of a web application. This track aims to make that link as secure as possible, given the constraint of 4 hours.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another important aspect is that web application security should be tailored to the risk profile of an organization and the specific development environment of that organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security\u00a0<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-03-27 23:12:15","post_date_gmt":"2019-03-28 04:12:15","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"was-100-000-understanding-web-application-security-for-developers-course-module","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-22 13:08:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-22 18:08:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=lp_course&#038;p=38844","menu_order":0,"post_type":"lp_course","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"course_category":[{"term_id":"162","name":"College Course","slug":"college-course","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"162","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"162"},{"term_id":"78","name":"General Focus","slug":"general-focus","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"78","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"   ","parent":"0","count":"4","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"78"},{"term_id":"79","name":"IT &amp; Software","slug":"it-software","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"79","taxonomy":"course_category","description":" ","parent":"78","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"79"},{"term_id":"1838","name":"RACC Series","slug":"racc-series","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1838","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"162","count":"3","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1838"},{"term_id":"88","name":"Technology","slug":"technology","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"88","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"  ","parent":"0","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"88"},{"term_id":"1839","name":"Web Application Security","slug":"web-application-security","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1839","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"1","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1839"}],"course_tag":false,"blooms_cognitive_process":false,"knowledge_focus":[{"term_id":"1994","name":"academic","slug":"academic","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1994","taxonomy":"knowledge_focus","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"40456","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1994"}],"id":38844},"7489":{"course_rational":"","course_resources":[{"ID":"13700","post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-11-04 05:45:28","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-04 10:45:28","post_content":"<p>This video is an excerpt from Zac's course on the WordPress REST API, part of the JavaScript for WordPress Master Course.In this video we look at the important technology HTTP, and everything about it we will need to know for working with the WordPress REST API.We talk specifically about the following:- HTTP Clients and Servers- HTTP Requests and Responses- HTTP Messages- HTTP Requests and Status Lines- HTTP Headers- HTTP Message Body- HTTP Headers- HTTPS- HTTP HistoryLINKS:- HTTP Request Methods - https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Methods- HTTP Status Codes - http:\/\/www.restapitutorial.com\/httpstatuscodes.html<\/p>","post_title":"A Deeper Look at HTTP (for WordPress REST API Users) | www.youtube.com","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-deeper-look-at-http-for-wordpress-rest-api-users","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-25 12:59:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-25 17:59:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=knowledge_resource&#038;p=13700","menu_order":"0","post_type":"knowledge_resource","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","pod_item_id":"13700"}],"syllabuses":[{"ID":"14729","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-04 18:28:06","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-04 23:28:06","post_content":"<p>This course teaches students to use Adobe Dreamweaver CC, the industry standard web design application.

We keep things simple because we truly want \"Everyone\" to learn! Under \"Modules\" the entire course has been laid out in a proprietary order that will guide you through all the learning objectives. Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \"Grades\" section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per week doing homework in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully. As the Instructor, I will monitor the \"Help Forum\" from time to time, but for this course to scale, it will be important that the participants in the course help each other.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

One of them is time management. Make sure to allocate enough time to do all the required work and beyond. Typical classes may require you to spend four to vie hours in the classroom, however, you are expected to spend an average of eight to twelve hours outside the classroom. The same amount of time should be expected and spend in an online class.<\/p>\r\n<p>Find your own time-schedule and follow it through the semester. For some students working on class activities at midnight will be fine while for others working at noon may be better. The key is to find the time that works best for you and be consistent.<\/p>\r\n<p>An extremely important aspect in an online environment is communication between you and the instructor and your peers. Remember, in an online class you are not alone. You have your classmates and your instructor. So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well. So I may ask you for your phone number in case that I need to call.

Each area and level of development or deployment organizations have specific needs and requirements regarding web application security education. A manager needs other information than a security professional or developer. Novices to the profession require other training than people with several years of experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>The OWASP Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>This Education Track provides in a 4 hour session covering what developers should know on web application security. It starts with an explanation of web application security and why it is important. Then the OWASP Top 10 is used to explain the nastiest vulnerabilities and how these can be prevented or re mediated. A secure coding initiative must deal with all stages of a program\u2019s life cycle. Secure web applications are only possible when a secure SDLC is used. The SDLC is explained from the standpoint of people, processes and tools. Particularly for developers good secure development practices are covered in a separate topic. Finally the track finishes with an exhaustive list of web application security resources for web application developers.<\/p>\r\n<h2><span id=\"Track_Audience\" class=\"mw-headline\">Track Audience<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>The track audience is web application developers who are unaware there are security issues with contemporary web applications. No prior knowledge of web application security is assumed nor necessary. This track is independent of the coding language or web frameworks used; like PHP, JSF, Java EE or .NET.<\/p>\r\n<p>We must realize that web application developers are only one link - albeit an important one - of the chain that represents the security of a web application. This track aims to make that link as secure as possible, given the constraint of 4 hours.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another important aspect is that web application security should be tailored to the risk profile of an organization and the specific development environment of that organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security\u00a0<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-03-27 23:12:15","post_date_gmt":"2019-03-28 04:12:15","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"was-100-000-understanding-web-application-security-for-developers-course-module","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-22 13:08:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-22 18:08:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=lp_course&#038;p=38844","menu_order":0,"post_type":"lp_course","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"course_category":[{"term_id":"162","name":"College Course","slug":"college-course","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"162","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"162"},{"term_id":"78","name":"General Focus","slug":"general-focus","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"78","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"   ","parent":"0","count":"4","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"78"},{"term_id":"79","name":"IT &amp; Software","slug":"it-software","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"79","taxonomy":"course_category","description":" ","parent":"78","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"79"},{"term_id":"1838","name":"RACC Series","slug":"racc-series","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1838","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"162","count":"3","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1838"},{"term_id":"88","name":"Technology","slug":"technology","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"88","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"  ","parent":"0","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"88"},{"term_id":"1839","name":"Web Application Security","slug":"web-application-security","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1839","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"1","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1839"}],"course_tag":false,"blooms_cognitive_process":false,"knowledge_focus":[{"term_id":"1994","name":"academic","slug":"academic","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1994","taxonomy":"knowledge_focus","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"40456","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1994"}],"id":38844},"7489":{"course_rational":"","course_resources":[{"ID":"13700","post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-11-04 05:45:28","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-04 10:45:28","post_content":"<p>This video is an excerpt from Zac's course on the WordPress REST API, part of the JavaScript for WordPress Master Course.In this video we look at the important technology HTTP, and everything about it we will need to know for working with the WordPress REST API.We talk specifically about the following:- HTTP Clients and Servers- HTTP Requests and Responses- HTTP Messages- HTTP Requests and Status Lines- HTTP Headers- HTTP Message Body- HTTP Headers- HTTPS- HTTP HistoryLINKS:- HTTP Request Methods - https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Methods- HTTP Status Codes - http:\/\/www.restapitutorial.com\/httpstatuscodes.html<\/p>","post_title":"A Deeper Look at HTTP (for WordPress REST API Users) | www.youtube.com","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-deeper-look-at-http-for-wordpress-rest-api-users","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-25 12:59:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-25 17:59:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=knowledge_resource&#038;p=13700","menu_order":"0","post_type":"knowledge_resource","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","pod_item_id":"13700"}],"syllabuses":[{"ID":"14729","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-04 18:28:06","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-04 23:28:06","post_content":"<p>This course teaches students to use Adobe Dreamweaver CC, the industry standard web design application.

We keep things simple because we truly want \"Everyone\" to learn! Under \"Modules\" the entire course has been laid out in a proprietary order that will guide you through all the learning objectives. Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \"Grades\" section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per week doing homework in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully.

We keep things simple because we truly want \"Everyone\" to learn! Under \"Modules\" the entire course has been laid out in a proprietary order that will guide you through all the learning objectives. Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \"Grades\" section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per week doing homework in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully. As the Instructor, I will monitor the \"Help Forum\" from time to time, but for this course to scale, it will be important that the participants in the course help each other.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more. I hope through sharing a little about my journey with you so you, you might understand what I have to offer you as a teacher, but more importantly, you establish a level of confidence in the knowledge that I will share with you about the industry and how you might position yourself to succeed.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">My journey began as a technical trainer for an organization named\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/maned.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzaZIw08L2xpQm5EsAjXdB1WVXxw\">Managing Editor Inc (MEI)<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\"> in Jenkintown Pennsylvania. At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

One of them is time management. Make sure to allocate enough time to do all the required work and beyond. Typical classes may require you to spend four to vie hours in the classroom, however, you are expected to spend an average of eight to twelve hours outside the classroom. The same amount of time should be expected and spend in an online class.<\/p>\r\n<p>Find your own time-schedule and follow it through the semester. For some students working on class activities at midnight will be fine while for others working at noon may be better. The key is to find the time that works best for you and be consistent.<\/p>\r\n<p>An extremely important aspect in an online environment is communication between you and the instructor and your peers. Remember, in an online class you are not alone. You have your classmates and your instructor. So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well. So I may ask you for your phone number in case that I need to call.

Each area and level of development or deployment organizations have specific needs and requirements regarding web application security education. A manager needs other information than a security professional or developer. Novices to the profession require other training than people with several years of experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>The OWASP Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>This Education Track provides in a 4 hour session covering what developers should know on web application security. It starts with an explanation of web application security and why it is important. Then the OWASP Top 10 is used to explain the nastiest vulnerabilities and how these can be prevented or re mediated. A secure coding initiative must deal with all stages of a program\u2019s life cycle. Secure web applications are only possible when a secure SDLC is used. The SDLC is explained from the standpoint of people, processes and tools. Particularly for developers good secure development practices are covered in a separate topic. Finally the track finishes with an exhaustive list of web application security resources for web application developers.<\/p>\r\n<h2><span id=\"Track_Audience\" class=\"mw-headline\">Track Audience<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>The track audience is web application developers who are unaware there are security issues with contemporary web applications. No prior knowledge of web application security is assumed nor necessary. This track is independent of the coding language or web frameworks used; like PHP, JSF, Java EE or .NET.<\/p>\r\n<p>We must realize that web application developers are only one link - albeit an important one - of the chain that represents the security of a web application. This track aims to make that link as secure as possible, given the constraint of 4 hours.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another important aspect is that web application security should be tailored to the risk profile of an organization and the specific development environment of that organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security\u00a0<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-03-27 23:12:15","post_date_gmt":"2019-03-28 04:12:15","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"was-100-000-understanding-web-application-security-for-developers-course-module","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-22 13:08:55","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-22 18:08:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=lp_course&#038;p=38844","menu_order":0,"post_type":"lp_course","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"course_category":[{"term_id":"162","name":"College Course","slug":"college-course","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"162","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"162"},{"term_id":"78","name":"General Focus","slug":"general-focus","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"78","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"   ","parent":"0","count":"4","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"78"},{"term_id":"79","name":"IT &amp; Software","slug":"it-software","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"79","taxonomy":"course_category","description":" ","parent":"78","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"79"},{"term_id":"1838","name":"RACC Series","slug":"racc-series","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1838","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"162","count":"3","object_id":"38761","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1838"},{"term_id":"88","name":"Technology","slug":"technology","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"88","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"  ","parent":"0","count":"3","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"88"},{"term_id":"1839","name":"Web Application Security","slug":"web-application-security","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1839","taxonomy":"course_category","description":"","parent":"0","count":"1","object_id":"38844","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1839"}],"course_tag":false,"blooms_cognitive_process":false,"knowledge_focus":[{"term_id":"1994","name":"academic","slug":"academic","term_group":"0","term_taxonomy_id":"1994","taxonomy":"knowledge_focus","description":"","parent":"0","count":"7","object_id":"40456","term_order":"0","pod_item_id":"1994"}],"id":38844},"7489":{"course_rational":"","course_resources":[{"ID":"13700","post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-11-04 05:45:28","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-04 10:45:28","post_content":"<p>This video is an excerpt from Zac's course on the WordPress REST API, part of the JavaScript for WordPress Master Course.In this video we look at the important technology HTTP, and everything about it we will need to know for working with the WordPress REST API.We talk specifically about the following:- HTTP Clients and Servers- HTTP Requests and Responses- HTTP Messages- HTTP Requests and Status Lines- HTTP Headers- HTTP Message Body- HTTP Headers- HTTPS- HTTP HistoryLINKS:- HTTP Request Methods - https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Methods- HTTP Status Codes - http:\/\/www.restapitutorial.com\/httpstatuscodes.html<\/p>","post_title":"A Deeper Look at HTTP (for WordPress REST API Users) | www.youtube.com","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-deeper-look-at-http-for-wordpress-rest-api-users","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-04-25 12:59:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-04-25 17:59:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=knowledge_resource&#038;p=13700","menu_order":"0","post_type":"knowledge_resource","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","pod_item_id":"13700"}],"syllabuses":[{"ID":"14729","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-04 18:28:06","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-04 23:28:06","post_content":"<p>This course teaches students to use Adobe Dreamweaver CC, the industry standard web design application.

We keep things simple because we truly want \"Everyone\" to learn! Under \"Modules\" the entire course has been laid out in a proprietary order that will guide you through all the learning objectives. Each of the learning objectives has one or more exercise and\/or an assessment quiz that you will do to work through the course. You can track your progress in the \"Grades\" section of Canvas. You should expect to spend 3-5 hours per week doing homework in this course. An important technique, if you find yourself struggling with the material, is to jump back and re-do an earlier section. Having a solid understanding of all the ideas in the course is more important than getting through the course successfully.

As the one who will be responsible for guiding you through this course I believe it is important to offer you the opportunity to understand the origin of my direction, expectations, and my basis in grading your efforts. Therefor I would like to share a brief history of my professional and personal journey to help you understand what it is that has placed me directly in the path of your future. I offer you this in understanding that I find myself weighing one\u2019s experience in the equation when placing value on their advice, direction, information, etc. This is not a required reading and there will be no quiz on this.

Shortly after quitting I obtained my GED and continued working in the restaurant and construction industries while trying to figure out who I was and where I was going. For a few years I attempted to move forward in my education by attending classes at Pikes Peak Community College, Colorado State University, Naropa Institute. I finally completed my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts here at RACC and several years later completed my BS in Computer Science at Albright College in their Accelerated Degree Program. I have academic goals that include completing my Masters at Penn State. I have an enormous respect for academics and have always maintained that it is the world\u2019s greatest resource for diverse and inspiring relationships that foster both personal and professional growth. I would encourage you to recognize this while on your academic journey and embrace all that you can from it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Professional\/Career<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c4\">I have been very fortunate to have had an exciting career in which I have had the honor to lead\u00a0 teams from around the world in website and application projects for organizations such as eBay, <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.godiva.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrsFpmRdlhXZ0-bOUPEBrpcIGkNA\">Godiva<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.sony.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8Q5lKALAKqUHDvEq12STF96Puzg\">Sony<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.dickssportinggoods.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFILndGe5UZaegX4PJt866oCfMrow\">Dicks Sporting Goods<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquoF4pe7LfE_mDSuvR0uMd5JrNQ\">Toys-R-Us<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.ferrari.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECXb_AMPanZHPkxOjmQ99nlxglqg\">Ferrari<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, and many more.

At MEI I consulted publication organizations on how to leverage technology to increase efficiencies in delivering publications such as magazines, newspapers, and books. For several years my week began on Sunday mornings in the Philadelphia Airport as I headed out, to somewhere in the world, to complete my objectives as a technical trainer. It was an exciting chapter for me considering these organizations included National Geographic, Gannet Publications, Mac World, and Playboy to name a few. Through these experiences I began to build a network and started freelancing, by creating micro-sites, and eventually found myself as the founder and CEO of\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2dzZh5nO5ZBqIcKXckSG1cXF3Jg\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/egavasdesign.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ7Tre2tU2g8gReuFX7WFHVXypPQ\">Egavas Design<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">\u00a0rapidly grew into a group of professionals collectively building high-end websites and applications. During this chapter of my career I had countless lessons in leveraging technology and capitalizing on opportunities, not only on sales, but on delivering websites that positioned organizations to operate more efficiently and cohesively. Many of the challenges we faced included international supply chain barriers and leveraging multicultural teams. After several years of success and growth we experienced a rapid decline in sales due to economic constraints. As our clients began to close their doors sales plummeted and the business model we embraced could not be maintained in the economic climate. In short, I had positioned our success on single high volume sales without considering establishing a financial base supported by a recurring revenue model. This was a hard lesson to learn as a young business owner, but a valuable one I am happy to share. For anyone with aspirations in spearheading a technology startup I would caution they be certain to include recurring revenue in the model and that they not get distracted by just high volume sales. Fortunately during this period of my journey I had established a credible reputation and broad network through which opportunities began to emerge. While the doors of Egavas Design closed I had been presented an opportunity to work with\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671581000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3xRt-OCNKv26ESQAo_XVJybiBOg\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">, the fifth largest advertising agency in Philadelphia Area, as their Director of Technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">During my time as Director of Technology at\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.streamcompanies.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaNTmFF3k3vA5BEjAQiZC9fJNRGQ\">Stream Companies<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\"> I lead a team of over fifty professionals in delivering web-based solutions, marketing strategies, and delivered ecommerce solutions for organizations that included top automotive dealerships, grocery and retail chains, and other notable Philadelphia-based organizations. Additionally I played a key role in fostering tremendous growth by opening a development shop in Old Town Philadelphia. During this time eBay had begun to communicate their interest in my taking over a segment of their ecommerce development team and so my journey with eBay began.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">Immediately I started delivering ecommerce solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest retailers. The segment I worked for was an extension of eBay's capabilities and resources which offered services that implemented, maintained, and managed ecommerce and digital business strategies. My accountabilities included managing every aspect of ecommerce solutions including development, support, marketing, client &amp; vendor management, as well as payment and fulfillment integrations. As I began to fine-tune my management strategies and established myself as a leader I came to be known as one who could motivate professionals to achieve the impossible. In short, I embraced the notion that leadership is the ability to have others do things in such a way that they want to do them for you. A simple strategy in which you understand what you are asking others to do, have the ability to sit beside them and do it with them, while treating them with respect and loyalty. Most importantly this strategy recognizes the value in understanding and caring about their personal aspirations and beliefs. While working with Godiva at eBay I had established a relationship through which they recognized my potential to change the way they approached digital opportunities and they began to peruse me to join the senior management team. It was a difficult decision but even eBay agreed that the opportunity was too good to turn down. I moved on to become, as my daughter called me, an Umpa Lumpa.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The first day I made my way from Penn Station to my office on 34th and 8th in New York City I was filled with excitement. I had all the tools to impact this major brand\u2019s digital presences, an opportunity to make a mark, and did I ever. Over the course of a year I lead efforts that increased digital-based sales by over 400%, revitalized the organization\u2019s digital perspective, and established internal process that increased efficiencies across the organization. Working for Godiva was an exciting time in my career and the experience seemed to be surreal as I lived the life of a Godiva Executive; remember this is a brand that lives the best there is to live. As time passed eBay began to pursue me and determined to have me return to the team there. At the same time the weight of being an absent father and husband had taken its toll personally and, in short, I returned to eBay.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">While completing my second tour at eBay I managed PetSmart\u2019s ecommerce and digital implementations and, once again, achieved the impossible through my approach to management. Collectively we burned down an impossible backlog of defects, increase the results of marketing efforts, and introduce new and exciting functionalities that prompted news worthy accolades in the industry. At the same time I had began to implement eBay's new strategy, which was actually an exit strategy, to sunset their ecommerce offerings and sell the ecommerce segment. A smart business decision considering eBay had begun to suffer a decline in their primary focus, the one you are well aware of, the eBay marketplace. Organizations such as Alibaba and Amazon were taking an increasing share of the market and if eBay were going to maintain its competitive presence they needed to return to their original business model which is to embrace their market website. My primary responsibility was to maintain a positive approach to implementing this strategy with teams that understood they were working themselves out of a job. In spite of the challenges we re-platformed <\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.spanx.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhl1EkGefe1LEmoaTIwmlr6o8-Q\">Spanx<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/store.irobot.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671583000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWkbx5wPkLTtJB2LwXwuJwkZLq9A\">iRobot<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c4\">, and\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.pepperidgefarm.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1503330671584000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWmhLBeIY0YC3dwQJF3Tlf2zBT_w\">Pepperidge Farm<\/a><\/span><span class=\"c3\">\u00a0ecommerce websites to the Open Source solution Magento in an unheard of time. In the end my efforts, once again, positioned me for opportunity and during this time I began conversations with Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">With an unbelievable offer on the table to move to Seattle and take over the interface side of Amazon\u2019s AWS offerings I faced one of the most difficult decisions in my life. During this time I had already been teaching for two semesters at RACC, and my passion for teaching had become a major factor in my decision. I did not shared early, but throughout my journey I had great successes as an instructor at a technical school and choose to leave teaching to pursue more money. From the time I left teaching forward I found myself missing it as though I had a huge part of me removed. Ultimately my conclusions lead me to embrace greater meaning and to dismiss weighing in financial rewards. Once I embraced this perspective my decision was simple and I will now spend the remaining years of my career fostering success in people by encouraging them to pursue a greater quality of life, a satisfaction of self-worth, and to prepare others to realize the success I have had the opportunity to embrace.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4 c6\">Personal<br \/>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"c3\">When I am not teaching or working on technology solutions I enjoy many different activities with my family and friends. I am an accomplished musician and enjoying most anything related to the outdoors, especially being in the woods or on the beach. Prior to becoming a father I spent a great deal of time traveling and have been fortunate to have explored many different places around the globe. \u00a0My favorite place to be is with my family and I firmly believe that being a parent is the greatest part of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c4\">I am excited to share my adventures and experiences with you and look forward to playing a role in preparing you for your future successes in the professional world. I look forward to working with you.<\/span><\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-08 12:04:22","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-08

So if you have any questions, please contact me via the CANVAS email feature or my RACC email at bsavage@racc.edu. Depending on the circumstances, I may call you as well. So I may ask you for your phone number in case that I need to call. Again, the key is to keep in touch with your instructor and peers.<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-01-05 11:41:36","post_date_gmt":"2019-01-05 16:41:36","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"online-course-information","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-01-05 11:41:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-01-05 16:41:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=syllabus_object&#038;p=14760","menu_order":0,"post_type":"syllabus_object","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"id":14760}},"associated_faqs":[],"assignment_and_lecture_schedule":{"40133":{"syllabus_object_focus":"","associated_resource":false,"syllabuses_used_in":false,"ID":40133,"post_title":"Assignment and Lecture Schedule | Brian Savage | 2019","post_content":"<p>The assignment and lecture schedule is available in Canvas under the Home, Modules, and Syllabus links.<\/p>\r\n<p>The lecture schedule is tentative and subject to change.<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-06-02 04:05:58","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-02 09:05:58","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"assignment-and-lecture-schedule-brian-savage-2019","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-06-02 04:05:58","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-02 09:05:58","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/?post_type=syllabus_object&#038;p=40133","menu_order":0,"post_type":"syllabus_object","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","comments":false,"id":40133}},"syllabus_objects":[],"course_objects":[],"canvas_sis_id":"76058","courses_used_in":{"6934":{"course_rational":"","course_resources":false,"syllabuses":[{"ID":"40438","post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-09-01 14:57:14","post_date_gmt":"2019-09-01 18:57:14","post_content":"<p>This course teaches students to use PHP to add functionality and interactivity to web sites.
