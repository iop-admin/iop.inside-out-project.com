There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let's quickly review each part of the element pictured:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p>HTML element (or simply, element) \u2014 a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p>HTML Tag \u2014 the element name, surrounded by an opening (<code>&lt;<\/code>) and closing (<code>&gt;<\/code>) angle bracket.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p>Opening Tag \u2014 the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p>Content \u2014 The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p>Closing tag \u2014 the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (<code>\/<\/code>) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lp_lesson\/13913"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lp_lesson"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/lp_lesson"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=13913"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lp_lesson\/13913\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":42035,"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lp_lesson\/13913\/revisions\/42035"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=13913"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"blooms_cognitive_process","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/blooms_cognitive_process?post=13913"},{"taxonomy":"knowledge_focus","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/knowledge_focus?post=13913"},{"taxonomy":"knowledge_level","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dev01.inside-out-project.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/knowledge_level?post=13913"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
